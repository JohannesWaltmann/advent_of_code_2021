# Advent of Code 2021

## My personal approaches towards getting along with the advent of code.
---
Main goal is to practice using python and secondary to structure code in a good readable form.
The code is structured with one folder per day containing a single file for each task.

Not every task up to and including day 12 is finished and the project was abandoned aferwards du to time scheduling issues.
